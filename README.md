# titanic-flask-Jashvanth
A Flask web application predicting Titanic passenger survival using Logistic Regression, with interactive inputs and real-time predictions.

This project predicts whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, passenger class, fare, and embarkation port. The model is trained using Logistic Regression and deployed as a Flask web application for interactive predictions.
